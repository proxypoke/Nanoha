NAME
----
Nanoha - the Nano Hardware Abstraction kernel

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Nanoha is Yet Another Kernelâ„¢, and really no attempt to write anything out of the
ordinary. It's a project for the sake of itself, and a quest for knowlegde. If
it will ever be useful is something I don't know, and really don't care about -
though it would be kinda cool.

As the name implies, Nanoha is supposed to become a microkernel. Whether I can
pull that off is unclear, but we'll see about that as I go along.

ROADMAP
-------
First of all, there's no real plan. There are some things, however, which
definitely need to be implemented to get anywhere:

- a simple VGA driver
- basic routines for operation and debugging (kprint, panic, etc)
- interrupt handling
- memory management (malloc, free, memcpy, etc)

Further down the road are things like a keyboard driver,
forking/multiprocessing, and a (simple) shell. I'm still undecided about using a
bash-like shell or porting, for example, a Scheme (or just implement one).

LIBC
----
Things which belong into a libc should be implemented as such. If, somewhen in
the future, Nanoha should need more than just small parts of a standard library,
it will be time to either port one of the available ones (like newlib) or write
more from scratch.
